      <h2>This is a bus tracker for RTS between the Transit Station and Rochester General Hospital</h2>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#10024;</span>Description:</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to map out a real time bus tracker. I chose to show the bus stops between the Rochester Transportation Service (RTS) transit station and Rochester General Hospital in Rochester NY. I made a few key changes from the original example shown in class. The first is that I added styles to my button to make it stand out more and look prettier. Instead of gray background with black text, it is now a chartrusse color with black text with a font size of 20px. Additionally, I changed the location from the original Cambridge, MA to Rochester, NY.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128187;</span>How To Run:</h2>
      <p>Open the index.html file, click on the “Show stops for between Transit Station and Hospital” button and the tracker should show all bus stops along Goodman Street.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128679;</span>Roadmap to Future Improvements:</h2>
      <p>This only shows one route along one main street, I would like to incorporate additional bus routes and perhaps color code them.</p>

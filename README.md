# RTS-Bus-Tracker.io
This is a bus tracker for RTS between the Transit Station and Rochester General Hospital

Description of the project:

The goal of this project was to map out a real time bus tracker. I chose to show the bus stops between the Rochester Transportation Service (RTS) transit station and Rochester General Hospital in Rochester NY. I made a few key changes from the original example shown in class. The first is that I added styles to my button to make it stand out more and look prettier. Instead of gray background with black text, it is now a chartrusse color with black text with a font size of 20px. Additionally, I changed the location from the original Cambridge, MA to Rochester, NY.

How to Run: 

Open the index.html file, click on the “Show stops for between Transit Station and Hospital” button and the tracker should show all bus stops along Goodman Street.

Roadmap for future improvements:

This only shows one route along one main street, I would like to incorporate additional bus routes and perhaps color code them.
